# Assignment 2

## Introduction to the dataset
This datastory explores the patterns in crime across San Francisco over a period of 10 years. This uses **the San Francisco Police Department Crime Dataset**, that contains detailed reports of incidents from 2014 to 2024. The dataset includes information such as crime categories, coordinates (latitude/longitude), districts and more. 

By analysis of this data, we want to cover how crime patterns have changed over time. In particular, this datastory will cover the patterns of crimes in the **drug/narcotic** category. This includes the variation across different neighborhoods and how the activity has developed in the different districts of San Francisco. 

To shows this we have made three different visualizations:

1. A bar chart that shows the frequency of drug crimes per year in San Francisco.
2. A heatmap video that shows the development of drug crime rates in different locations across San Francisco over the 10 years.
3. An interactive Bokeh chart that compares the drug crime rates in the different districts.
